I think this is how we add reviews, we'll see what happens. Anyways, this looks good, you've avoided the most obvious confusion others have, which is when they follow the book they tend to close the window they made in function() before they ever really used it. For the most part you followed the book's instructions well, word for word, so that's the easy part. I would recommend in the future adding more inline comments like '//doing xyz here' and '/* I am doing this because blah blah */'. It will help others who look at your code to be able to pick it apart and know what and why you're doing things. It will also help you when you make bigger programs so that you can keep track of what different parts of your code do what. Other than that, this looks great! Good Job!
